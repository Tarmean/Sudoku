# [Sudoku][]

A reasonably fast Sudoku solver in Haskell.


It solves the 49151 17-clue puzzles in ~3.4 seconds or parallelized in under 1.   
Fair warning, the code is optimized for performance over readability. In other words it is a horrid ritualistic sacrifice to shared mutual state - but at least it's fast.
